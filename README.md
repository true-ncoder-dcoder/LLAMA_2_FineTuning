# LLAMA 2 Fine-Tuning

This repository, [LLAMA_2_FineTuning](https://github.com/true-ncoder-dcoder/LLAMA_2_FineTuning/tree/main), contains the code for fine-tuning the LLAMA 2 model using Python and several supporting libraries such as Hugging Face's Transformers, PEFT, and BitsAndBytes. The project aims to enhance the LLAMA 2 model's performance for specific tasks or datasets by applying techniques like Quantization and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).

## Installation

To set up your environment to run the code, you need to install the required libraries. Execute the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install transformers peft bitsandbytes trl deepeval evaluate

python <your_script_name>.py
